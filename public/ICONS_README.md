# PWA Icons Needed

The app requires the following icon files:

## Required Icons

1. **icon-192.png** (192x192px)
2. **icon-512.png** (512x512px)

## How to Create Icons

### Option 1: Use an Online Tool
- Visit https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Upload a square PNG/SVG (512x512 or larger)
- Download the generated icons
- Place `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` in `/public/`

### Option 2: Use Image Editor
- Create a 512x512px image with your design
- Export as `icon-512.png`
- Resize to 192x192px and export as `icon-192.png`

### Option 3: Simple Placeholder (Temporary)
Use the included `icon-template.html` file:
1. Open `icon-template.html` in a browser
2. Take a screenshot at 512x512
3. Save as `icon-512.png`
4. Resize to 192x192 for `icon-192.png`

## Design Recommendations

- **Simple & Bold**: Icon should be recognizable at small sizes
- **Consistent Branding**: Use the app's blue color (#2563eb)
- **Contrasting Colors**: Ensure visibility on different backgrounds
- **Center Focus**: Keep important elements in the center (safe zone)

## Current Placeholder

Temporary colored squares are used until proper icons are created.
This won't affect functionality but proper icons will improve user experience.
